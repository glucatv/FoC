# Fundamentals of Computing

## Syllabus

Introduction to computational method. Von Neumann architecture. Programming languages: assembler, compiled, and interpreted languages. Basic concepts of programming languages: variables; data types and assignment; control structures (loops, conditional selection); basic data structures; input and output. Functions and recursion. Searching and sorting algorithms. Computational complexity. Dynamic data structures: array; linked lists; trees; hash tables. Object oriented programmin.

The programming languages taught are Python and C.
