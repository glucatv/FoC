# Fundamentals of Computing

## Syllabus

Introduction to computational method. Von Neumann architecture. Programming languages: assembler, compiled, and interpreted languages. Basic concepts of programming languages: variables; data types and assignment; control structures (loops, conditional selection); basic data structures; input and output. Functions and recursion. Searching and sorting algorithms. Computational complexity. Dynamic data structures: array; linked lists; trees; hash tables. Object oriented programming.

The programming languages taught are Python and C.

### Week 2

- A first look to the components of a programming language: data (floating point, integer and boolean); variables; the assignment operator; arithmetic, relational and logical operators; output; control of flow with while; blocks of code; comments.
- The string data type: assignment, relational operators, concatenation, repetition, indexing. The `len()` function.
- the `for` statement;
- The `if`...`elif`...`else`  statement and other  variants;  the `for` statements and the `range` function;
- The `enumerate` function
- The `in` statement;
- Type conversion: the functions `int()` and `float()`
- The function `input()`
- The `break` statement
- The `ord()` and `chr()` funcionts
- The slicing operator over strings
